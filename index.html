        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tania Hernandez, and I am currently a second-year college student at the University of California, Riverside, pursuing a major in Psychology with a focus on Law and Society. Growing up in the small town of McFarland, California, I developed a strong appreciation for community and the importance of helping others. This background has significantly influenced my academic and professional aspirations. From a young age, I have been fascinated by psychology and the intricacies of the human brain. My interest lies not just in understanding mental processes but also in applying this knowledge to help others navigate their challenges. I believe that psychology is a powerful tool for fostering empathy and social understanding, especially in today’s complex world. My goal is to leverage this understanding to make a positive impact, whether through advocacy, counseling, or research.<br><br>

        During my time at UC Riverside, I have sought out various opportunities to deepen my knowledge and skills. One of my notable achievements includes serving as a student assistant in a statistics building. In this role, I honed my analytical abilities and gained hands-on experience in data management, which is crucial for understanding psychological research. Additionally, I interned in a political environment where I engaged in phone banking, making calls to constituents to discuss important issues. This experience not only enhanced my communication skills but also allowed me to appreciate the intersection of psychology and civic engagement. In addition to my academic pursuits, I pride myself on being a dependable and quick learner. My bilingual abilities have been invaluable in both my personal and professional interactions, allowing me to connect with a diverse range of individuals. I excel in customer service and teamwork, understanding that collaboration is key to achieving common goals. My attention to detail and punctuality are qualities I value deeply, ensuring that I contribute positively to any team I am part of.<br><br>

        I am also proficient in tools like Excel and Outlook, which have further equipped me with the skills necessary for effective organization and communication in both academic and professional settings. As I continue my education, I am eager to explore opportunities that will allow me to apply my knowledge in real-world contexts, whether in research, community service, or policy advocacy. Looking ahead, I am excited about the future and the paths that lie before me. I am particularly interested in exploring how psychological principles can inform law and societal structures, ultimately promoting justice and equality. My journey is just beginning, but I am committed to making a difference in the lives of others and contributing to a more understanding and compassionate society. In summary, I am Tania Hernandez—a psychology student, community advocate, and lifelong learner, dedicated to understanding the human experience and using that knowledge to support those around me. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that await in my academic and professional journey.
